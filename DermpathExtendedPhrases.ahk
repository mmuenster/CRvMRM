::afxmfh::Many authors consider atypical fibroxanthoma to represent a superficial variant of pleomorphic unclassified sarcoma (formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma), in which the better prognosis is due to the superficial location.  If this lesion extends deeply, the prognosis may not be as good as would be expected for an atypical fibroxanthoma. REFERENCE: Miller K. et al.

::atypicalsmooth::Many experts in soft tissue tumors now advocate the term atypical smooth muscle tumor with recurrent potential rather than leiomyosarcoma for atypical smooth muscle tumors that are confined to the dermis.  However, lesions with similar cytology that extend into the subcutis have the potential for more aggressive clinical behavior and are termed cutaneous leiomyosarcoma (see references below).

::badspitz::Overall, the architectural and cytologic features are most consistent with a Spitz nevus with atypia. The clinical behavior of spitzoid lesions is notoriously difficult to predict however, particularly in adults, and there have been reports of lesions that histologically resemble Spitz nevi but behaved in an aggressive manner.  Therefore, some authors feel that there is no clear way to distinguish between atypical Spitz nevi and malignant melanoma (see reference below). Gerami P, Busam K. et al. Histomorphologic Assessment and Interobserver Diagnostic Reproducibility of Atypical Spitzoid Melanocytic Neoplasms With Long-term Follow-up. Am J Surg Pathol. 2014 Jul;38(7):934-40.

::judge1::Clinical judgment is recommended in determining whether to re-excise this site. Factors to be considered include whether the biopsy contains the majority of the lesion or if much of the lesion remains behind, how concerning the lesion was clinically, how concerned the patient is and whether there are relative contraindications to re-excision.
::larger1::If this biopsy represents a portion of a larger lesion, it may not be representative of the lesion as a whole.
::levels1::Initial and level sections were examined.
::lid1::lichenoid interface dermatitis
::matrix1::If there is continued clinical concern for a melanocytic lesion, biopsy of the matrix may be helpful.
::mild1::The cytologic atypia within melanocytes is only focal and mild.
::miss1::melanoma in situ, superficial spreading type
::mixed1::Periodic acid-Schiff stain highlights hyphae and yeast forms within the nail plate, consistent with a mixed infection.

::persist1::If a pigmented lesion persists or recurs at this site, additional sampling or re-excision is recommended.
::previous1::This current case was reviewed in conjunction with the patient's prior case (***).
::protrude1::Although nests of melanocytes protrude into the papillary dermis, no definite invasion is identified.
::punch1::On occasion, when a punch biopsy is performed, the superficial portion of the specimen remains within the punch biopsy instrument.  Clinicopathologic correlation is recommended.

::regression1::In lesions with regression, the possibility of a regressed invasive component cannot be excluded.
::report1::Report corrected, discrepancy resolved and completed.
::residual1::Occasionally, when scar extends to the margin, residual lesion may be present in the adjacent skin.
::sample1::The surface of keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma often demonstrates areas of benign epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation.  If your clinical suspicion persists, deeper biopsy may be helpful.
::sampling1::Sampling variability refers to the variation in the degree of atypia observed in small biopsies taken from large melanocytic lesions. This phenomenon is documented in the literature, and may be resolved if multiple biopsies are taken from different areas of a large pigmented lesion, or by completely removing the lesion for histologic examination.
::scalp1::This pattern of atypia, lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia, and dusty melanin pigment is not uncommon in scalp nevi from children and young adults.
::scarce1::The scarcity of the yeast suggests that they are commensal rather than pathogenic.
::shoulder1::Despite the presence of a 'shoulder' (extension of the junctional component lateral to the dermal component) in this lesion,  no significant cytologic atypia is appreciated.

::bccag::This variant of basal cell carcinoma may behave in a more aggressive manner.
::acdvc::The presence of spongiotic intraepidermal microvesicles, although not specific, supports the diagnosis of a contact dermatitis over other eczematous processes.
::dysec::The presence of spongiotic intraepidermal microvesicles, although not specific, supports the diagnosis of dyshidrotic dermatitis over other eczematous processes.
::nosde::Although a spongiotic drug eruption cannot be entirely excluded, it is less favored due to the degree of epidermal changes and the superficial nature of the inflammation.
::nops::Although the diagnosis of psoriasis cannot be entirely excluded, it is less favored due to the presence of spongiosis, eosinophils, and preservation of the granular layer.
::ddxacdhs1::The histologic differential diagnosis would also include hypersensitivity reaction to other allergens, such as to a medication, an arthropod bite, or infestation.
::ddxacdhs2::The histologic differential diagnosis would also include hypersensitivity reaction to other allergens  such as to a medication, arthropod bite and/or infestation and in this age group, consideration is also given to the prebullous phase of an immunobullous disorder.
::ddxscpd::The differential diagnosis for subcorneal pustular dermatitis includes pustular psoriasis, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, IgA pemphigus, acute generalized exanthematous pustular dermatitis, and impetigo.
::ddxc1::Athough the diagnosis of *** was considered, given the presence of *** the above diagnosis is favored.
::ddxc2::The histopathologic differential diagnosis would also include *** .
::noed::Although a chronic eczematous dermatitis cannot be entirely excluded due to the presence of spongiosis, the parakeratosis with diminished granular layer, prominence of the dermal papillae vasculature, and lack of eosinophils, all favor the diagnosis of psoriasis over an eczematous dermatitis in this sample.
::acralps::It is often difficult to distinguish between a lesion of psoriasis and spongiotic dermatitis on acral skin. The stratum corneum in this biopsy is consistent with that seen in psoriasis. Although given the presence of spongiosis an eczematous dermatitis cannot be entirely excluded, the focally diminished granular layer with overlying neutrophilic parakeratosis and the lack of eosinophils favor the diagnosis of psoriasis.
::txe::The subtle nature of the findings may be secondary to prior treatment effect.
::txfree::Additional sampling following a treatment free period could be considered for further evaluation, if clinically indicated.
::ddxtle::While the histopathologic differential diagnosis also includes reticular erythematous mucinosis, many authors consider the latter to be the same entity as tumid lupus. Consideration was also given to a figurate erythema, Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate, and polymorphous light eruption; however, the increase in dermal mucin argues against these diagnoses.
::papde::There is mild papillary dermal edema.
::mec::There are minimal epidermal changes.
::hsrc::Within the dermis, there is a mixed cell infiltrate with scattered eosinophils which may represent an underlying hypersensitivity reaction.
::te1::While the percentage of catagen/telogen hairs is not significantly increased, the findings in this biopsy would be consistent with resolving telogen effluvium in the appropriate clinical context, as in the resolving phase of telogen effluvium the biopsy findings are essentially within normal limits.
::te2::While androgenetic alopecia and diffuse alopecia areata can also show increased catagen/telogen hairs (and cannot be entirely excluded), the lack of a significant increase in the number of miniaturized hairs supports the diagnosis of telogen effluvium.
::fmucc::Features in favor of primary idiopathic follicular mucinosis include young age, solitary lesion (particularly on head and neck), and spontaneous resolution.
::mleio::"Multiple leiomyomas may be a manifestation of Reed syndrome (predisposition to multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis and occasionally renal cell carcinoma).
::pskera::The findings are consistent with psoriasis in the appropriate clinical context. If this is an isolated lesion, however, and the patient has no prior history of or other current lesions of psoriasis, a psoriasiform keratosis is also a consideration.
::kps::Due to the degree of psoriasiform hyperplasia and presence of neutrophilic parakeratosis, koebnerization of or superimposed psoriasis is a consideration in the appropriate clinical context.
::badspitz1::Overall, the architectural and cytologic features are most consistent with a Spitz nevus with atypia. The clinical behavior of spitzoid lesions is notoriously difficult to predict, however, as there have been reports of lesions that histologically resemble Spitz tumors but behaved in an aggressive manner.
::badspitz2::Although the lesion has some concerning features, there is insufficient evidence for an outright diagnosis of malignant melanoma based on the morphologic findings alone, and we would place it into the group of atypical Spitz tumors, thereby acknowledging an element of uncertainty about its biologic/malignant potential.
::badspitz3::Treatment as for a spitzoid melanoma and close clinical follow up are recommended.
::astcom::The morphologic features are consistent with an atypical Spitz tumor. This category of lesion may spread to local lymph nodes and while occasionally showing more aggressive behavior, recent literature demonstrates that, for the most part, they follow an indolent course without spread beyond the regional lymph node basin.
::fishprog::Due to the difficult nature of the case and the clinical implications, it is being submitted for cytogenetic analysis to further assess the potential for aggressive behavior.
::mmnev::This is a difficult case due to the presence of some epithelioid cell (spitzoid) features and nevoid areas. Taken together, however, the degree of cytologic atypia, presence of areas of pagetoid upward scatter (including into the granular layer), lack of uniform maturation, and presence of dermal mitotic activity, all support malignant transformation (melanoma) arising in association with (and/or to some extent simulating the appearance of) an atypical nevus.
::spitzmm::This is a challenging case as spitzoid lesions are notoriously difficult to categorize and predict the clinical behavior of, particularly in adults. Although there are several overlapping features with an atypical Spitz tumor, and some would consider an interpretation of atypical Spitz tumor/melanocytic tumor of uncertain malignant potential, this lesion has a number of worrisome features. The lesion is asymmetric, deep, fails to mature, demonstrates marked pleomorphism, and contains dermal mitoses. Given these features, particularly in a patient this age, we all favor interpretation and treatment as a spitzoid melanoma.
::melbump::We believe this tumor should best be regarded as having uncertain biologic potential. The lesion extends to margins, and an excision to ensure complete removal is recommended.
::fishneg::The lesion has a negative melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization profile (see attached report ***). A positive result would have supported the diagnosis of melanoma. The sensitivity of the test is approximately 85%. Since a negative melanoma FISH test does not entirely exclude the possibility of melanoma, excision with appropriate margins and close clinical follow up are recommended.
::dpncom::The natural history and biological behavior of deep penetrating nevus-like lesions are not well understood. A conservative re-excision is recommended to prevent local recurrence/progression.
::regression2::In lesions with regression, the possibility of a regressed more significant component cannot be excluded.
::regression3::The findings are consistent with a regressed melanocytic lesion. Although the late stage of a halo nevus is a possiblility, in lesions with complete regression, the possibility of a regressed more significant melanocytic neoplasm cannot be excluded.
::ppemneg::A negative direct immunofluorescence result does not exclude the possibility of paraneoplastic pemphigus, as the incidence of false negative direct immunofluorescence results appears to be higher in paraneoplastic pemphigus than in other forms of pemphigus.
::dmak::There is a background of multifocal actinic keratosis.
::pitp::A PAS stain highlights scattered yeast forms consistent with Pityrosporum; however, no fungal hyphae are identified.
::mitf1::A MITF immunostain (with appropriate controls) supports the above findings.
::Nar::Although the examined margins are free, the tumor is present within *** mm from the *** margin.
::nomites1::No scabies mites were detected on initial and multiple additional levels examined.
::Both2::MART1 and MITF immunostains (with appropriate controls) support the above findings.
::inc::An incidental *** is also present.
::incidn::An incidental intradermal nevus is also present.
::inccn::An incidental compound nevus is also present.
::sund::The lesion is present on sun-damaged skin.
::cul::Correlation with tissue culture result is recommended, if clinically feasible.
::reactive2::There is focal reactive squamous atypia.
::Superf::Because only the superficial aspect of the lesion is present for review, *** cannot be excluded.
::ihc1::Immunohistichemical stains reveal that the lesional cells are positive for *** and are negative for ***, supporting the above diagnosis.
::mildirr::There is mild cytologic atypia, which is likely due to irritation.
::pigpar1::There is pigmented parakeratosis and mild intraepidermal involvement, suggestive of previous irritation or excoriation.
::pic::The submitted clinical image is reviewed (and is appreciated).
::pics::The submitted clinical images are reviewed (and are appreciated).
::crrpr::An excision to ensure complete removal and to allow for examination of the entire lesion is recommended.
::dfo::Diagnostic features of *** are not appreciated in the examined sections.
::sun3::There is a background of solar elastosis and mild lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia of small basally located melanocytes, consistent with chronic sun exposure.
::mma::Although there is mild melanocytic atypia, these changes are favored to be reactive, and secondary to the scar/recurrent nevus phenomenon.
::herp::If clinically indicated, immunohistochemical stains for HSV and VZV can be performed at your request to further characterize the infection.
::noinv::Where the base of the lesion is available for evaluation, no invasive carcinoma is identified.
::bnd::Because minimal dermis is available for evaluation, the possibility of underlying *** cannot be fully assessed.
::mitfneg::A MiTF immunostain reveals even distribution of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction, without confluent growth or significant upward scatter.
::trauma2::Some of the atypia may be due, at least in part, to recurrent nevus phenomenon.
::trauma3::There is upper dermal fibrosis and pigment incontinence with overlying features of recurrent nevus phenomenon, suggestive of prior irritation / trauma to the lesion.
::tpalneg::A T. pallidum immunostain was performed, which is negative for spirochetal organisms.
::tpalc::Despite the negative stain, correlation with serologies is recommended, if clinically indicated.
::bset::There is a background of solar elastosis and telangiectasia.
::oldca::There are no definite viral changes of HPV infection; however, an old condyloma acuminatum may appear similar and remains in the differential diagnosis.
::bccstroma::Although no basal cell carcinoma is identified in this biopsy, stromal changes typical of basal cell carcinoma with retraction artifact is present at the base. These changes are suspicious for underlying basal cell carcinoma.
::cllc::In patients with B-CLL, cutaneous infiltrates of neoplastic lymphocytes can frequently be seen in biopsies of many different skin conditions, likely as recruitment of the patients circulating neoplastic leukemic cells to sites of inflammation due to various chemotactic stimuli.
::ddxalp::The histologic differential diagnosis for lobulocentric acute panniculitis includes infection, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated panniculitis, panniculitis due to physical or factitial agents, and pancreatic panniculitis (although the latter is considered less likely due to the lack of the characteristic saponification with ghost cells).
::ddxen::Erythema nodosum can occur as an idiopathic phenomenon, or in a number of clinical settings, including infections, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and various medications (particularly antibiotics, estrogen, bromides, isotretinoin, echinacea, and azathioprine).
::ddxlcv::Leukocytoclastic vasculitis represents a vascular reaction pattern due to circulating immune complexes, that can be caused by a number of underlying disorders, including infection, drugs, autoimmune diseases, mixed cryoglobulinemia, as a paraneoplastic phenomenon (rarely), or in the setting of a systemic vasculitis. The histologic features are essentially the same regardless of the underlying etiology.
::ddxlelpp::The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injuring is lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. Differentiation between these two processes can be difficult on biopsy, and is based on a variety of factors, including examination of the depth of the inflammation, presence of deep dermal mucin deposition, involvement of interfollicular epithelium, and perivascular extension of inflammation.
::demfoll::Consideration is also given to rosacea-like demodicosis as well, given the presence of frequent demodex mites within hair follicles and the fragments of mites within the dermal suppurative inflammation present.
::ddxnseb::The sections show subepidermal blister formation with associated papillary dermal edema. Within the blisters is a dense neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate with fibrin and karyorrhectic debris. The histologic findings are consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis in the appropriate clinical setting. Also in the histologic differential diagnosis are linear IgA disease, bullous lupus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (inflammatory variant), and even pemphigoid (vesicular/polymorphic variant). An early lesion of Sweet's syndrome is also a consideration (since rarely Sweets can also show the presence of dermal papillary microabscesses).
::ddxcpb::The differential diagnosis for a cell-poor subepidermal blister is broad and includes prior trauma, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, porphyria, pseudoporphyria, bullous diabeticorum, and the cell-poor variant of bullous pemphigoid.
::primprur::The possibility of a primary pruritus without an underlying dermatitis is a consideration.
::poik::Poikiloderma can be seen in the setting of chronic sun exposure (including poikiloderma of Civatte). Although poikiloderma can also be seen in the setting of connective tissue disease, I do not see an inflammatory pattern to support this diagnosis in this sample.
::end1::The depth of the inflammation and lack of significant epidermal changes favor an endogenous rather than an exogenous allergen.
::nomorph::Although no evidence of morphea is appreciated, the deep dermal / subcutaneous junction (where the changes of morphea typically begin), is not available for evaluation. Therefore, if clinical suspicion for morphea persists, a punch biopsy to include subcutis is recommended, if clinically indicated.
::fad1::There is a focus of acantholytic dyskeratosis, which may be incidental, or could reflect transient acantholytic dermatosis (Grover's disease).
::irr::The findings are consistent with chronic irritation / excoriation.
::hakscc::Because the base of the lesion is not completely visualized, the possibility of underlying invasion (squamous cell carcinoma) cannot be fully assessed.
::clonalsk::This lesion also has clonal features in which there are nests of keratinocytes displaying cellular atypia. While this finding is judged to be reactive, should this lesion persist or recur complete removal is recommended, if clinically indicated.
::mka::There is mild keratinocyte atypia consistent with chronic sun exposure.
::lkmel::Due to the presence of obscuring inflammation, a MART-1 immunostain was obtained, which is negative for an associated melanocytic neoplasm.
::minmod::Although the cytologic atypia is relatively minimal, this lesion demonstrates areas with a single cell predominance, and scattered melanocytes above the dermoepidermal junction.
::dnscp::In addition to architectural disorder and cytologic atypia, this lesion demonstrates areas with a single cell predominance.
::minmod1::Although the cytologic atypia is relatively minimal, this melanocytic proliferation is broad and ill-defined, with a single cell predominance, and scattered melanocytes above the dermoepidermal junction. Although the findings are insufficient for an outright diagnosis of malignancy, they are atypical, particularly in a patient this age, on sun-damaged skin.
::sevlm::If this biopsy contains the majority of the lesion, the most likely diagnosis is a severely dysplastic nevus. However, if the lesion is significantly larger, lentigo maligna is a diagnostic consideration.
::pbx::If this represents virtually all the lesion, then it is possible that this represents the surface of a *** with atypia. Considering the location and the age of the patient, however, the larger any residuum of this lesion is, the more pressing becomes the alternative possibility of a more atypical lesion, in the differential diagnosis. Because the diagnostic dilemma cannot be resolved in this partial biopsy, ***.
::broad1::This lesion is broad and ill-defined, with scattered melanocytes present above the dermoepidermal junction.
::mod1::Although the lesion may represent an early dysplastic nevus, it is ill-defined and predominantly composed of single melanocytes, without good nest formation.
::mod2::Although the lesion may represent an early dysplastic nevus, it is ill-defined and predominantly composed of single melanocytes. The pattern of growth is highlighted with a MART-1 immunostain. 
::mod3::Although the findings are not sufficient for an outright diagnosis of lentigo maligna, the proliferation is too florid to be considered within the spectrum of melanocytic hyperplasia of sun-damaged skin, and is best interpreted as an early precursor lesion.
::mod4::Although the findings are not sufficient for an outright diagnosis of lentigo maligna, this is an atypical lesion, particularly in a patient this age on sun-damaged skin, and is best interpreted as an early precursor lesion.
::pnev::A second smaller more nested population of banal melanocytes is present at the dermoepidermal junction and focally in the papillary dermis in nests with maturation, consistent with a precursor nevus.
::anevc::The lesion does persist at the biopsy margins, and recurrence/progression therefore cannot be excluded. In general, in nevi with unusual or atypical features, a complete excision is recommended.
::nfpag::Fully evolved pagetoid scatter across the breadth of the lesion is not appreciated.
::ddxgl::The findings are consistent with 'genital lentiginosis' if more than one lesion is clinically present, or with an isolated lentigo if the lesion is solitary. Multiple genital lentigos in the setting of oral pigmentation is consistent with Laugier-Hunziker disease (idiopathic lenticular mucocutaneous pigmentation). Patient's with Carney's complex can also present with multiple genital lentigos.
::incong::Since the clinical and histologic findings seem somewhat incongruous, clinical correlation is recommended to ensure that the biopsy is representative of the underlying clinical disorder. A repeat biopsy could be considered, if deemed clinically appropriate.
::collfe::colloidal iron stain
::fish1::fluorescence in situ hybridization
::pnim::Perineural invasion is identified, involving small caliber (< 0.1 mm in diameter) nerve fibers.
::tickref::The apparent tick was sent to a reference lab for identification, and the findings will be reported in an addendum.
::ihcprog::Immunohistochemical stains for *** are in progress and the findings will be reported in an addendum.
::lab1::Initial and multiple additional levels (performed in our laboratory) were examined.
::bpap::If this is one of multiple lesions, it may represent Bowenoid papulosis.
::bgo::There is a background of ***.
::difnegle::Note that a negative direct immunofluorescence result does not exclude the diagnosis of lupus, as up to approximately fifty percent of biopsies from lesional skin can show negative direct immunofluorescence results in patients with lupus.  In addition, most patients with dermatomyositis present with a negative lupus band.
::difnegbp::In lesions of bullous pemphigoid that are predominantly confined to the lower extremities, there is a higher rate of false negative direct immunofluorescence results.  If clinical suspicion of bullous pemphigoid persists, a repeat biopsy for direct immunofluorescence from the inner thigh or forearm is recommended, if clinically indicated.
::noinvscc::No invasive squamous cell carcinoma is identified on the sections examined.
::novit::A MART-1 immunostain reveals a normal number and distribution of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction, arguing against vitiligo

Abnormal expression of all four mismatch repair proteins is a relatively uncommon pattern. In the colon literature this pattern does not appear to be strongly associated with Lynch sydrome due to the role methylation plays; however, as methylation does not appear to be as prevalent in sebaceous neoplasms with MMR protein deficiency, this pattern may be more likely due to a single primary underlying abnormality combined with secondary downstream alterations. While Muir-Torre/Lynch syndrome is favored, other mechanisms of mismatch repair protein loss may also occur.

::hpv-::In situ hybridization fails to demonstrate high risk (16,18)  or low risk (6, 11) human papilloma virus in this tissue. As with any standardized test, there are some limitations.  The major limitation is the potential for error in HPV typing because of probe cross-hybridization and relatively low sensitivity.  Additionally, if the viral DNA is low, there might not be detection. Finally, the probe only detects specific HPV types, so there might be infections caused by other strains of the virus not detected by this method.

::FISHM::The morphologic features of this tumor fall into the category of atypical Spitz tumor of uncertain biologic potential. Due to the inherent limitations in the ability of morphologic assessment to accurately predict clinical behavior in Spitzoid lesions, the tumor was submitted for the melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization test to further assess the potential for aggressive behavior.  The melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test was positive for MYB loss (see attached report ***). There is preliminary data to suggest that atypical Spitz tumors with isolated MYB (6q23) loss show less evidence of aggressive behavior (e.g. advanced locoregional spread, distant metastases, or death) than atypical Spitz tumors with gains in RREB1 or CCND1 or 9p21 deletion (see references below). These tumors have been provisionally termed atypical Spitz tumor with 6q23 deletion, and appear to represent a subset of Spitzoid neoplasms that often result in a positive sentinel lymph node but only occasionally progress beyond this; although the data are limited and further follow-up studies are needed.

::FISHT::Given the difficulty of this case along with the clinical implications, the tumor was submitted for the melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization test to further assess the potential for aggressive behavior (see attached report ***). Gains in RREB1 and CCND1 were found; however, there was evidence of tetraploidy which can be seen in benign (~ 5-10 % of Spitz nevi show tetraploidy), borderline, and malignant melanocytic tumors and therefore it is considered a nondiagnostic finding and explains the gains seen in RREB1 and CCND1.. A clearly positive FISH test would have supported the diagnosis of melanoma. Given evidence of tetraploidy we hesitate to designate the FISH result as definitively positive. Nonetheless, the malignant potential of this lesion cannot be predicted with certainty, as the clinical behavior of atypical spitzoid lesions is notoriously difficult to predict. Re-excision is advised to minimize risk for persistent growth, recurrence, and/or tumor progression. Reference:  1.Issac, A. K., Lertsburapa T, Pathria Mundi, J, Martini T, Guitart J, Gerami P.

::FISN1::Given the difficulty of this case along with the clinical implications, the tumor was submitted for the melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization test to further assess the potential for aggressive behavior. Using probes to loci on 6p, 6q, 6cent, 9p, 9cent, and 11q, the enumerated copy number gains and/or losses did not meet FISH criteria for melanoma (see attached report  ***). A positive result would have supported the diagnosis of melanoma. Based on available literature, the sensitivity of the assay is estimated to be 85% and the specificity 95%. False negative results may be due to sampling error, sample handling, aberrations below the level of detection, or aberrations in chromosomal areas other than those tested in this assay. Given the concerning morphologic features present, this lesion is thus considered at the very least in the MELANOCYTIC TUMOR OF UNCERTAIN MALIGNANT POTENTIAL category, with melanoma (***mm, level ***) not excluded.

Using probes to loci on 6p, 6q, 6cent, 9p, 9cent, and 11q, the enumerated copy number gains and/or losses did not meet FISH criteria for melanoma (see attached report  ***). A positive result would have supported the diagnosis of melanoma. Based on available literature, the sensitivity of the assay is estimated to be 85% and the specificity 95%. False negative results may be due to sampling error, sample handling, aberrations below the level of detection, or aberrations in chromosomal areas other than those tested in this assay. Although a false negative FISH result cannot be entirely excluded, the negative result, in combination with the overall morphologic findings, make a bonafide melanoma less likely and favor an indolent lesion (probable *** nevus with atypia).

Although a false negative FISH result cannot be entirely excluded, the negative result, in combination with the overall morphologic findings, make a bonafide melanoma less likely and favor an indolent lesion. Given the atypical features present, however, it is prudent to acknowledge some uncertainty about the biologic potential of the lesion. It is difficult to exclude the possibility that the atypical features reflect a significant biologic change (e.g. nevus undergoing early malignant transformation).

Although the age of the patient, negative FISH result, and *** are reassuring, given the atypical morphologic findings and the notorious difficulty in predicting the clinical behavior of spitzoid tumors, the lesion is best classified as an atypical Spitz tumor, with acknowledgement of some uncertainty as to its biologic potential. Complete excision and clinical follow up are recommended.
::FISP2::Given the difficulty of this case along with the clinical implications, the tumor was submitted for the melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization test to further assess the potential for aggressive behavior. By report, the melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test was positive for *** (see attached report ***). Although there was also evidence of tetraploidy (which can be seen in benign, borderline, and malignant melanocytic tumors), tetraploidy does not account for the ***9p21 homozygous deletion and/or gains in RREB1 relative to CEP6 and/or MYB loss***, and the results therefore meet FISH criteria for melanoma.  Based on the morphologic findings, in combination with the abnormal FISH results, the lesion is best interpreted and treated as melanoma.
::FISP1::Given the difficulty of this case along with the clinical implications, the tumor was submitted for the melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization test to further assess the potential for aggressive behavior. Using probes to loci on 6p, 6q, 6cent, 9p, 9cent, and 11q, the enumerated copy number gains and/or losses meet FISH criteria for melanoma (see attached report ***). Based on the morphologic findings, in combination with the abnormal FISH results, the lesion is best interpreted and treated as melanoma.
