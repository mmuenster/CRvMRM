/*  The following is for placing your personal codes.  The format is as follows...
::code::Text to be replaced by code

Some guidelines.  
1) Try not to use real words for codes, especially if it is a commonly used word.  
2) 'Return' key can be included by using a `n.  That puts in a new line.  For long codes, use the multilinecode2 formatting below.
3) This file has many options available to it.  This is just an autohotkey script file that the coderocket is calling.  For more details, check out 'hotstrings' at http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm
4) The format of this file is very specific.  Improper edits can cause an error in the CodeRocket.  Don't change the header unless you know what you are doing.
5) You must use unique codes from the group master code file.  ie, you can't create your own 'protrude1' code.  Any codes which are duplicated from the groups code file will be ignored by the program.
6) Most codes will only require you to edit the stuff between the double colons "::".  The first phrase is the code.  The second is what it will be replaced by.

-High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. See comment.
Comment: Appropriately controlled immunohistochemical stains composed of PIN4 cocktail antibodies (Cytokeratin 5/14+p63+AMACR (racemase)) were performed in the suspicious focus with following results: Cytokeratin 5/14 and p63 (nuclei) is positive for basal cells in patchy distribution and AMACR is over expressed in luminal cell cytoplasm. These findings support the diagnosis of HGPIN.
