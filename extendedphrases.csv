The clinical behavior of spitzoid lesions is notoriously difficult to predict however, particularly in adults, and there have been reports of lesions that histologically resemble Spitz nevi but behaved in an aggressive manner.  Therefore, some authors feel that there is no clear way to distinguish between atypical Spitz nevi and malignant melanoma (see reference below). Gerami P, Busam K. et al.

"1707","badspitz1","Overall, the architectural and cytologic features are most consistent with a Spitz nevus with atypia. The clinical behavior of spitzoid lesions is notoriously difficult to predict, however, as there have been reports of lesions that histologically resemble Spitz tumors but behaved in an aggressive manner. "
"1708","badspitz2","Although the lesion has some concerning features, there is insufficient evidence for an outright diagnosis of malignant melanoma based on the morphologic findings alone, and we would place it into the group of atypical Spitz tumors, thereby acknowledging an element of uncertainty about its biologic/malignant potential."
"1709","badspitz3","Treatment as for a spitzoid melanoma and close clinical follow up are recommended."
"1710","astcom","The morphologic features are consistent with an atypical Spitz tumor. This category of lesion may spread to local lymph nodes and while occasionally showing more aggressive behavior, recent literature demonstrates that, for the most part, they follow an indolent course without spread beyond the regional lymph node basin."
"1711","fishprog","Due to the difficult nature of the case and the clinical implications, it is being submitted for cytogenetic analysis to further assess the potential for aggressive behavior."
"1712","mmnev","This is a difficult case due to the presence of some epithelioid cell (spitzoid) features and nevoid areas. Taken together, however, the degree of cytologic atypia, presence of areas of pagetoid upward scatter (including into the granular layer), lack of uniform maturation, and presence of dermal mitotic activity, all support malignant transformation (melanoma) arising in association with (and/or to some extent simulating the appearance of) an atypical nevus."
"1713","spitzmm","This is a challenging case as spitzoid lesions are notoriously difficult to categorize and predict the clinical behavior of, particularly in adults. Although there are several overlapping features with an atypical Spitz tumor, and some would consider an interpretation of atypical Spitz tumor/melanocytic tumor of uncertain malignant potential, this lesion has a number of worrisome features. The lesion is asymmetric, deep, fails to mature, demonstrates marked pleomorphism, and contains dermal mitoses. Given these features, particularly in a patient this age, we all favor interpretation and treatment as a spitzoid melanoma."
"1714","melbump","We believe this tumor should best be regarded as having uncertain biologic potential. The lesion extends to margins, and an excision to ensure complete removal is recommended."
"1715","fishneg","The lesion has a negative melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization profile (see attached report ***). A positive result would have supported the diagnosis of melanoma. The sensitivity of the test is approximately 85%. Since a negative melanoma FISH test does not entirely exclude the possibility of melanoma, excision with appropriate margins and close clinical follow up are recommended."

"1755","cllc","In patients with B-CLL, cutaneous infiltrates of neoplastic lymphocytes can frequently be seen in biopsies of many different skin conditions, likely as recruitment of the patients circulating neoplastic leukemic cells to sites of inflammation due to various chemotactic stimuli."
"1756","ddxalp","The histologic differential diagnosis for lobulocentric acute panniculitis includes infection, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated panniculitis, panniculitis due to physical or factitial agents, and pancreatic panniculitis (although the latter is considered less likely due to the lack of the characteristic saponification with ghost cells)."
"1757","ddxen","Erythema nodosum can occur as an idiopathic phenomenon, or in a number of clinical settings, including infections, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and various medications (particularly antibiotics, estrogen, bromides, isotretinoin, echinacea, and azathioprine)."
"1758","ddxlcv","Leukocytoclastic vasculitis represents a vascular reaction pattern due to circulating immune complexes, that can be caused by a number of underlying disorders, including infection, drugs, autoimmune diseases, mixed cryoglobulinemia, as a paraneoplastic phenomenon (rarely), or in the setting of a systemic vasculitis. The histologic features are essentially the same regardless of the underlying etiology."
"1759","ddxlelpp"," The differential diagnosis for lymphocyte-mediated scarring alopecia with interface injuring is lichen planopilaris and lupus erythematosus. Differentiation between these two processes can be difficult on biopsy, and is based on a variety of factors, including examination of the depth of the inflammation, presence of deep dermal mucin deposition, involvement of interfollicular epithelium, and perivascular extension of inflammation."
"1760","demfoll","Consideration is also given to rosacea-like demodicosis as well, given the presence of frequent demodex mites within hair follicles and the fragments of mites within the dermal suppurative inflammation present."
"1761","ddxnseb","The sections show subepidermal blister formation with associated papillary dermal edema. Within the blisters is a dense neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate with fibrin and karyorrhectic debris. The histologic findings are consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis in the appropriate clinical setting. Also in the histologic differential diagnosis are linear IgA disease, bullous lupus, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (inflammatory variant), and even pemphigoid (vesicular/polymorphic variant). An early lesion of Sweet's syndrome is also a consideration (since rarely Sweets can also show the presence of dermal papillary microabscesses)."
"1762","ddxcpb","The differential diagnosis for a cell-poor subepidermal blister is broad and includes prior trauma, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, porphyria, pseudoporphyria, bullous diabeticorum, and the cell-poor variant of bullous pemphigoid."
"1763","primprur","The possibility of a primary pruritus without an underlying dermatitis is a consideration."
"1764","poik","Poikiloderma can be seen in the setting of chronic sun exposure (including poikiloderma of Civatte). Although poikiloderma can also be seen in the setting of connective tissue disease, I do not see an inflammatory pattern to support this diagnosis in this sample."
"1765","end1","The depth of the inflammation and lack of significant epidermal changes favor an endogenous rather than an exogenous allergen."
"1766","nomorph","Although no evidence of morphea is appreciated, the deep dermal / subcutaneous junction (where the changes of morphea typically begin), is not available for evaluation. Therefore, if clinical suspicion for morphea persists, a punch biopsy to include subcutis is recommended, if clinically indicated."

"1768","irr","The findings are consistent with chronic irritation / excoriation."

"1775","minmod1","Although the cytologic atypia is relatively minimal, this melanocytic proliferation is broad and ill-defined, with a single cell predominance, and scattered melanocytes above the dermoepidermal junction. Although the findings are insufficient for an outright diagnosis of malignancy, they are atypical, particularly in a patient this age, on sun-damaged skin."
"1776","sevlm","If this biopsy contains the majority of the lesion, the most likely diagnosis is a severely dysplastic nevus. However, if the lesion is significantly larger, lentigo maligna is a diagnostic consideration."
"1777","pbx","If this represents virtually all the lesion, then it is possible that this represents the surface of a *** with atypia.

Because the diagnostic dilemma cannot be resolved in this partial biopsy, ***."
"1778","broad1","This lesion is broad and ill-defined, with scattered melanocytes present above the dermoepidermal junction."
"1779","mod1","Although the lesion may represent an early dysplastic nevus, it is ill-defined and predominantly composed of single melanocytes, without good nest formation."
"1780","mod2","Although the lesion may represent an early dysplastic nevus, it is ill-defined and predominantly composed of single melanocytes. The pattern of growth is highlighted with a MART-1 immunostain. "
"1782","mod3","Although the findings are not sufficient for an outright diagnosis of lentigo maligna, the proliferation is too florid to be considered within the spectrum of melanocytic hyperplasia of sun-damaged skin, and is best interpreted as an early precursor lesion. "
"1783","mod4","Although the findings are not sufficient for an outright diagnosis of lentigo maligna, this is an atypical lesion, particularly in a patient this age on sun-damaged skin, and is best interpreted as an early precursor lesion."
"1784","pnev","A second smaller more nested population of banal melanocytes is present at the dermoepidermal junction and focally in the papillary dermis in nests with maturation, consistent with a precursor nevus."
"1785","anevc","The lesion does persist at the biopsy margins, and recurrence/progression therefore cannot be excluded. In general, in nevi with unusual or atypical features, a complete excision is recommended."
"1786","nfpag","Fully evolved pagetoid scatter across the breadth of the lesion is not appreciated."
"1787","ddxgl","The findings are consistent with 'genital lentiginosis' if more than one lesion is clinically present, or with an isolated lentigo if the lesion is solitary. Multiple genital lentigos in the setting of oral pigmentation is consistent with Laugier-Hunziker disease (idiopathic lenticular mucocutaneous pigmentation). Patient's with Carney's complex can also present with multiple genital lentigos."

Abnormal expression of all four mismatch repair proteins is a relatively uncommon pattern. In the colon literature this pattern does not appear to be strongly associated with Lynch sydrome due to the role methylation plays; however, as methylation does not appear to be as prevalent in sebaceous neoplasms with MMR protein deficiency, this pattern may be more likely due to a single primary underlying abnormality combined with secondary downstream alterations. While Muir-Torre/Lynch syndrome is favored, other mechanisms of mismatch repair protein loss may also occur.

Finally, the probe only detects specific HPV types, so there might be infections caused by other strains of the virus not detected by this method. "

Due to the inherent limitations in the ability of morphologic assessment to accurately predict clinical behavior in Spitzoid lesions, the tumor was submitted for the melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization test to further assess the potential for aggressive behavior.  The melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test was positive for MYB loss (see attached report ***). There is preliminary data to suggest that atypical Spitz tumors with isolated MYB (6q23) loss show less evidence of aggressive behavior (e.g. advanced locoregional spread, distant metastases, or death) than atypical Spitz tumors with gains in RREB1 or CCND1 or 9p21 deletion (see references below). These tumors have been provisionally termed atypical Spitz tumor with 6q23 deletion, and appear to represent a subset of Spitzoid neoplasms that often result in a positive sentinel lymph node but only occasionally progress beyond this; although the data are limited and further follow-up studies are needed.

A clearly positive FISH test would have supported the diagnosis of melanoma. Given evidence of tetraploidy we hesitate to designate the FISH result as definitively positive.
