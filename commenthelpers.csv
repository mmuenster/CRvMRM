36,1,No atypia or malignancy is identified.
37,2,"Despite mild architectural abnormalities, no significant cytologic atypia is appreciated."
38,3,"Despite dark pigmentation, no significant cytologic atypia is appreciated."
39,4,"Despite dark pigmentation and mild architectural disorder, no significant cytologic atypia is appreciated."
40,5,Initial and multiple deeper sections were examined.
41,6,No significant melanocytic atypia is appreciated.
42,7,A MART-1 immunostain (with appropriate controls) stains melanocytes and was used to highlight their distribution.
43,8,A MiTF immunostain (with appropriate controls) stains melanocytes and was used to highlight their distribution.
44,9,"Very little subungual debris is present in the specimen.  If there is strong clinical suspicion for tinea, it may be helpful to obtain another biopsy with more subungual material."
45,a,"Although mild squamous cell atypia is noted, these changes are interpreted as reactive."
46,b,No basal cell carcinoma is identified.
47,c,Complete removal is recommended.
48,d,No basal cell carcinoma or melanocytic neoplasm is identified.
49,e,No basal or squamous cell carcinoma is identified.
50,f,No fungi are detected with a periodic acid-Schiff stain.
51,g,Initial and level sections were examined.
52,h,"I would be happy to discuss this case with you, if you would like, in order to arrive at a better clinicopathologic correllation."
53,i,"Because the base of the lesion is not completely visualized, an invasive component cannot be entirely excluded. "
54,j,The base of the lesion cannot be fully evaluated. 
55,k,The lesion is transected and therefore its base cannot be fully evaluated.
56,l,"If this biopsy represents a portion of a larger lesion, it may not be representative of the lesion as a whole."
57,m,No melanocytic neoplasm is identified.
58,n,The examined margins are negative.
59,o,The lesion arises in a background of actinic keratosis.
60,p,Initial and multiple deeper sections were examined through the block.
61,q,"If a pigmented lesion persists or recurs at this site, additional sampling or re-excision is recommended. "
62,r,A conservative excision is recommended to prevent recurrence.
63,s,No squamous cell carcinoma is identified.
64,t,There is superficial erosion suggestive of trauma to the lesion.
65,u, 
66,v,No melanocytic atypia is identified.
67,w,No significant cytologic atypia is appreciated.
68,x,"There is also a scar, consistent with prior surgical site. "
